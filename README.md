## Phone controllers (2 players on PC)
On the character select screen (PC), scan the left QR code for Player 1 and the right one for Player 2.
Each phone opens `controller.html` (stick + Y/X/B/A + START) and talks to the PC directly through WebRTC (PeerJS).
When Player 2's phone is connected, Player 2 picks the second fighter and plays instead of the CPU.
